<h1>SQF Symphony</h1>
<h3>An experimental visualization and sonification of a year's worth of stop, question, and frisks.</h3>
<p>First started at <a href="http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/" target="_blank">The New York World</a> with Alice Brennan, this project is an experiment in visualizing the 685,724 stop, question, and frisks in 2011 in New York City. It is still a work in progress. Planned additions are cumulative counts by neighborhood, some graphs in the nav, data for every month and a few other ideas.</p>

<p>Darker colors and lower tones signify stops that led to arrests. Roughly 25,000 stops lack geographical information. These are still included so that the frequency of stops is still comprehensive. The dots for these stops will appear over New Jersey</p>
